## Cakephp Addresses Plugin ##

The Addresses plugin is a building-block plugin that should be the de-facto standard for address data. This plugin
requires the states plugin, also available on gitub.

TODO: The Addresses plugin has two branches, the master branch which requires the States plugin, and the countries branch, 
which requires the Countries and States plugin. The master branch only contains Unites States only dropdowns for states 
and the countries branch includes the dropdowns for countries.
